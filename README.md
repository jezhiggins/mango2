##mango2

Mango2 is a Java iterator and range library.

Mango2 is range-based version of my earlier [iterator library](https://github/jezhiggins/mango) [inspired by talks and articles by Steve Love and Andrei Alexandrescu](http://www.jezuk.co.uk/blog/2013/11/the-forest-road-reader-no-112.html). It is now [effectively obsoleted](http://www.jezuk.co.uk/blog/2013/11/the-forest-road-reader-no-113.html) by Java 8 Streams.
